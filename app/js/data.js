      synopsis: 'Adrianne Lenker is raised in a religious sect. Her father/manager wants to make her a child star. Lenker is already playing bars at the age of twelve. A year later she releases her first album. Father/daughter relations turn sour. As it turns out, that bizarre past is not all bad. Lenker draws on it for her output in Big Thief today. It\'s so vast a source of inspiration that the New York four-piece release not one but two albums in 2019. ‘U.F.O.F’ and ‘Two hands’ are both received as essential, contemporary short story collections. Big Thief makes carefully composed folk rock with raw power and human warmth. It\'s always a good sign when a newcomer is extolled by a genre\'s best exponents. Jeff Tweedy (Wilco) is full of praise for Big Thief and The National’s Matt Berninger does a live cover of ‘Not’',

      name: 'BLACK PUMAS',
      synopsis: 'Imagine soul singer Sam Cooke and proto-rocker Neil Young in the Wu-Tang Clan hip hop collective. That should give you a rough idea of Black Pumas, a project run by an extraordinary duo from Austin, Texas. Adrian Quesada is in his forties and was once the guitarist for the nine-piece band Grupo Fantasma, winners of the Grammy for Best Latin Album in 2010. Quesada had a few instrumental tracks in his studio that were crying out for a soulful voice. Some friends recommended Eric Burton, a busker from downtown Austin, and the rest is history. The Black Pumas’ debut is just about flawless. Its psychedelic soul earned the two musicians the title of ‘breakout band of 2019’ in the US. Great stuff for anyone who has enjoyed Alabama Shakes, Durand Jones & The Indications or Curtis Harding at Werchter in recent years.',

      synopsis: 'Robin Daniel Skinner comes from an unusual musical family. Both of his parents are elite classical musicians. Their son learned to play the guitar at the age of eight and soon turned to pop music. Robin started posting songs on YouTube and Bandcamp in 2012. His melodic bedroom pop gained a fanatical following that developed into a global community. Skinner has performed a series of sold-out concerts in London, Los Angeles and New York. Fans queue for hours for tickets and bring kazoos on which they accompany their young hero. It’s all very authentic and organic, and now very popular too. Some numbers: a million subscribers on YouTube and more than 60 million streams for sweet pop tunes like ‘Boys Will Be Bugs’ and ‘This is Home’. Don’t forget your kazoo!',

      synopsis: 'Everyone agreed after Gorillaz blew the roof off the Werchter stage in 2018 - the brainchild of comic artist Jamie Hewlett and Blur’s Damon Albarn is one of the best live acts ever. Some of the headlines: ‘So much grandeur’. ‘An infectious carnival’. ‘Dancing towards a better world’. Shortly afterwards, Albarn announced that we shouldn’t expect too much over the next ten years. Then in January this year, they presented the musical concept ‘Song Machine’. And next year, the first virtual band in history is heading back out on tour. From now on, Gorillaz will release music in episodes, whenever new material is ready. Each episode features a different guest:  in 2020 the likes of slowthai, Fatoumata Diaware, Peter Hook (New Order), Georgia and Octavian joined forces with the band.',

      synopsis: 'Trucker hat, beard, tattoos… Rory Graham may look slightly terrifying, he’s actually a big friendly giant. And that certainly comes across in ‘Human’ (2016), a heartfelt song that became an instant classic. Graham\'s stage name is from Rags’n’Bonez, a drum’n’bass project that he started in his hometown of Brighton at the age of fifteen. He\'s mad about hip hop, but his greatest discovery in music is the blues. One day, dad Graham entered his boy for a jam session in a local pub. Rory performed a song by blues legend Robert Johnson, and from that moment on, he was well and truly hooked. His first album ‘Human’ (2017) became the fastest selling debut album in years. His latest single ‘Giant’ (2019), a duet with Calvin Harris, was nominated in the Song of the Year category at the Brit Awards.',

      synopsis: 'Royal Blood is an unashamedly loud duo from Brighton in the UK. The duo found each other when bassist/vocalist Mike Kerr returned from a trip to Australia in 2013. Drummer Ben Thatcher picked him up at the airport, and on the way home they decided to start a band. They played their first gig the very next day. Royal Blood produce a delicious kind of noise that has been compared to Queens of The Stone Age and The White Stripes. They were catapulted into the limelight when Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders wore one of the band’s t-shirts on stage at Glastonbury 2013. Next, they were selected for BBC Sound Of 2014, the annual list of promising artists drawn up by members of the UK music press. A review of their previous Werchter appearance in 2017 said, ‘Royal Blood played the main stage to smithereens’. This is the pair’s fifth time.',

      name: 'THE DEAD SOUTH',
      synopsis: 'An infectious and cheery country group from the wide open prairies of Canada. However, The Dead South started out as a rough and ready grunge band. Nate Hiltes and Danny Kenyon, however, soon tired of all that noise. They convinced two friends to learn to play mandolin and banjo. The four of them turned to bluegrass, the folk music of immigrants in the south-eastern United States. The Dead South inject the genre with humour. On one hand they are in love with the music, while on the other they like to laugh about it. The result sounds like the drunken cousins of Mumford & Sons. These modern hillbillies have developed into a popular party band, with their own dance moves. However, there is a darker edge to them. The merriment disguises their stories of despair and deceit. They are beautiful stories, though.',

One might say that alt-J do something similar with pop history. The British trio picks the best moments of the last sixty years and subverts them within their own universe. They are just as committed and inventive as Sigur Rós or The xx. Their fairytale world is clearly at home at Werchter. As Humo wrote of their first appearance in 2013: ‘How much excruciating beauty can one person take, and how much sugary emotion? Alt-J changed your life in The Barn.’ And as Moustique witnessed in 2015: ‘Alt-J joins the big league.’ There has been a promising silence around the group since their last tour in 2017 …',
